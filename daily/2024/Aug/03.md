# notes for keyboard set up

- layer 1 needs to be for my alpha numeric keys
- layer 2 for arrows, symbols such as braces, mods
- layer 3 for other random shit like vol up next track brightness?

## layer 1

todo

probably also want home row mods

- enter not efficient
- symbols are also not efficient on base layer
- left shift also not efficient
- backspace setup also abit jank

just going to use the qmk setup it is alot easier
