## keyboard layouts

- [ ] add proper symbol layer
- [ ] add gaming layer on default
- [ ] swap homerow mod for gui and alt

## random vim shit

- [x] add a command for saving using leader bs

maybe enable keydown repeat for backspace

## symbol layer

using sunaku's layout for symbol layer
but he got 40 keys and using 34

i only have 27. so i need to trim down 7 keys to use

- backspace, delete and right shift on base layer can definitely be changed to an infrequently used symbol or something that i am already familiar with in that position
  - maybe pipe character cos it's pretty infrequently used for me?
  - maybe no quotes and double quotes too
  - no left right arrows, no dots and commas
- i will remove symbols that are repeated on base layer

- looking at the diagram i edited, i will: shift square brackets to top outside lparens like so: \[()\]
- backtick will shift to outermost like now
- negation operator will shift to outermost also
- dk what to put on thumb cluster for symbols.
- i should put either vim or an often repeated inward roll.

## learnings

- need to learn shortcuts for rectangle so that i can tile easier

## bug for new block being persisted

is cos when we set the saved page state in componentselector, we update to already include the new block

when i click into a block, i need to set the state that it is from adding a new block
i need to reset this when i leave
return <ComplexEditorStateDrawer />
return <MetadataEditorStateDrawer />
