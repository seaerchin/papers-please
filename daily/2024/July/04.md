# Goals

- [ ] make changes to isobot PR
- [x] review nixon PR
- [ ] listing for isomer ogp org for infra
- [ ] get list of amplify sites that require update using aws script
- [x] write translation layer for tiptap and components
- [ ] write active index handler properly

## Translation layer

- [ ] need to convert from `JSONContent` to `ProseProps`
  - [x] need to add `caption` to the table node
  - [ ] need to add `caption` to the table bubble menu so users have some way to inject it
  - [x] hide individual native block exports from components and shift into `Prose`
  - [x] json content has `attrs` but we need to shift each individual item in `attrs` out to the top level
  - [x] need to update attrs in schema
    - [x] we know that this is done because we validated against the editor for ol/ul/h/
    - [!] undone: h1 (need to tell sehyun to take out title), quote block not done (check w/ sehyunnie whether should be callout)
  - [~] validation at frontend before preview
    - [x] done for tiptap
      - [!] not very ideal - because this is as good as a cast as the validate function will accept your typing as truth
    - [ ] this will be done using json schema (ajv)
  - [x] can prose accept a generic object type? rather than rejecting, we just do a union?

# Learnings

- actually we need to lock into tiptap's schema -> alot of tiptap's functionality is based off prosemirror schema, which assumes a certain shape
  - case in point: `attrs.<col|row>span` -> prosemirror's table ext uses those exact props
- schema need to do a spread for sub-components -> the reference is a symlink (`#/<path>/<to>/<something>`)
  - why does spreading solve this?
  - because the correct path is `#/<new_prop>/<path>/<to>/<something>`
- content implicitly locks into `heading` -> changes to schema is very difficult
- we need to reference the json schema for typings
