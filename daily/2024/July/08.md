## Update page

(decision points)

- abstraction for edit page/dnd state seems to be doing too little
- hold the snapshot state in `editorState`, set on entry and pop on exit (`RootStateDrawer`)
- `updatePageState` is called on every single update of the tiptap editor -> leads to multiple renders
- shove props into `attrs`
- update random shit for toc generation
