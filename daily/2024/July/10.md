# Goals

- [x] pair with kr
- [x] rebase and push PR
- [ ] setup infra repo

# Dashboard PR

- useZodForm
- can use the same schema across front and backend
- mutation don't need suspense because suspense requires a `fallback` component
  - means that from our inner component where the saving is happening,
  - we need to feed the variables up the tree into our `Suspense`
- separating content and modal itslef os that we can reset the content on modal close
- use `key` to re-render -> anytime `key` changes, react will re-render

# learnings

- to validate typebox, i need to use `TypeCompiler`
