# Goals

- [ ] setup infra repo
  - [x] base repo
    - need to update cf to advanced cert manager so that we can automatically have certs for \*_._.isomer.gov.sg
    - tried using acm, didn't work cos cf not authorised?
      - failed to create custom ssl cert: Unauthorized to access requested resource (9109)
  - [ ] deploy file on app
  - [ ] working deploy from `main` and `staging`
    - [ ] app
    - [ ] infra
- [ ] check with designer on what mvp needs
- [ ] prose renderer
- [ ] s3 bucket for multiple sites per bucket
  - can consider looking at lambda@edge then transform incoming requested

## Prose renderer

- json schema defines underlying data
- ui schema just defines how to render
- we have to recursively decompose the typebox library
- the `JSONForms` component recursively walks your schema

  - it tests using the testers defined in the order given
  - if match -> render

- [ ] need to update state to `ComplexEditor`
- [ ] have it call the respective renderer
- [ ] add accordion renderer + prose?
