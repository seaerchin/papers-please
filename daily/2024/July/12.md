# Goals

- [ ] PR for slack bot
- [ ] PR for renderer
- [ ] publishing flows
  - explore lambda@edge

# resume deep dive

- wall between intra and internet
- kubes cluster
- dmz cluster
- firewall + encryption over transport
- resilience using saga pattern through micro-services
- use kubes driver to write to smb
- what is the cache he's talking about??? if 1 use why need a cache

- not v clear on communication

## coding round

- he has a scaffold for his interview already!
- candidate sets up tests first
- he didn't read criteria but is that bad bad?
- checks his assumptions using tests -> i think this is good

- why hashmap though -> we require consecutive ordering not just by vax
- ts ability like v sus leh (type error, using double equal)
- hinted but i think candidate still on the wrong track ripge
  - wrong condition post 2x hint (initial failing case pointed out, hinted after during hashmap)
- feels like candidate made a bad decision for code structure then locked it in
  - to be fair he said he was gonna refactor post correctness
- he didn't notice certain criteria despite hinting
- runtime complexity of sort + foreach unable to reason

## System design

- assumptions not probed -> k8s is a compute layer
  - what happens if your attached volume runs out of storage
  - what type of workload
  - what type of traffic pattern?
- feels alot like he just use the tool without understanding why
- uptime requirement??

# learnings from shadowing

## coding round

- re: kr -> don't disturb interviewee's flow
  - adapt to interviewee's preferences so they can perform to their best ability rather than be disruptive
- let the candidate fumble? non-ideal data structure but let him flounder abit first

## System design

- emulate how ogp works -> requirements aren't fleshed out, more testing what trade-offs you're ok w. in practice
- focus shouldn't be on the actual "block storage" part but the candidate's choices and why

# jest

- has `each` function so i can do `it.each`
