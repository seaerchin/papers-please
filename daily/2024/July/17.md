# workflow for infra

## secrets

NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN }}

## optimistic loading

- expensive now because we write the whole blob through
- don't want to do that -> i want to update each item cheaply
- shift blob into 2 tables
  - blob (contains page level metadata)
  - block (actual isomer block)
- ordering?
- permitted operations on block:
  - create new block
  - delete new block
  - update content of new block
  - move block (update idx)
- permitted operations on blob
  - crud
  - if delete, i shud cascade delete teh block also

alternatively, we can just send the delta of positions first

- fix the keys: key stats, footer and hero

## route params

- can use `useRouter` to get dynamic routes
