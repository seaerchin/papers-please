# Goals

- [ ] fix up infra deploy
- [ ] deploy workflow for isomer

  - app spec
  - deploy file w/ proper creds
  - set up creds in github

- [ ] task definition for app

- [ ] checklist
  - reset main db
  - check flows for blob id
  - add PR for linking created page to edit page
  - different renderers should be ok
  - cut new branch

# Bugs

- [x] now when i click x out of empty box, the box will still be created
- no renderer for infobar/infopic/infopic/infocols
- accordion doesn't show the prose renderer
- [x] no label for prose

# misc

- need to add default blocks because we add the default block use the current page index to access the block

## accordion doesn't show the prose renderer

- the component tells the schema what to render
- could be properties defined wrongly - not too sure how to check
  - probably not, tested against playground
- [ ] alternative explanation is that this is getting a `$ref` and hence, what we are checking for doesn't exist
  - not walking to the `details` section oddly
- need to use the schema, NOT the uischema

## now when i click x out of empty box, the box will still be created

- when i go out of the block and click x, it pops the saved state and shifts it to preview
  - this was cause we were using the saved state -> we should switch to using the preview state throughout
  - the saved state is supposed to be the one that we got back from the db

## Fixes

- from, to has to be 0
- our page condition needs to be &&
- setPreviewPageState(nextPageState) -> previouslyi was `pageState`
- reorderBlock -> updateBlobById should be `pageId`
- preview vs saved -> componentselector/formbuilder/complexeditor

# Code base polish

- definitely want to tidy up loading states for saves -> right now we eagerly go back
- definitely want to shift the blocks themselves out to the table and push top level props to table or somewhere
- `VStack` in root state drawer listens on click event but we have a drag handle also
- need to invalidate queries
- need proper loading states probably for data fetching and stuff
  - suspense?
  - 1 eg: custom blocks pane, esp when invalidate + refetch
- how do we handle recursive blocks? right now it's 1 drawer per level but we only do 0/1 so for eg: key stats, it's not very usable
- schema and app boundary?
  - JSONForms needs schema values for sure - if we pass `$ref`, it can't resolve properly and the tester will fail
  - need to provide a sane entrypoint

# Learnings

- IconButton requires you to pass `icon = { <ActualIcon /> }`

  - sizing via `fontSize`

- hero not working
- infopic variant not exposed? -> default to 1 variant
- floating buttons removed
- renderengine issue
- page preview for creation wonked -> need to shift drop shadow out
