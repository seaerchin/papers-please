# Goals

- [ ] fix bugs in isomer
- [ ] run uat

## add link schema

- [ ] frontend

  - [ ] need to generate schema for consumption by Tiptap component
  - [ ] need to expose tiptap ext in menubar for use

- [ ] components
  - [ ] we need to know how to render

this also implies our accordion, callout and other stuff also have links

where is source of truth for schema? referred to tiptap repo for `attrs`, should be roughly correct

### blockers

- `type is possibly infinite` on `generatedTypes`

  - this got added by my addition to text schema, which only removed `href` at top level and added `attrs`

- [ ] add quote schema
  - see above, similar approach
