# Goals

- [ ] ship error handler PR
- [ ] review nixon PR
- [ ] maybe write PR for PHAS endpoint upodate for referrals

## error handler

### Aims

- [ ] should let the caller decide how to handle the errors
- [ ] should be easy to work with since we are a new codebase
- [ ] clear distinction between errors out from pb, errors from fetch (can retry and succeed), programmer errors

### Notes

- pb wretch previously set default url - `this.config.get("partnersBuddy.baseUrl`
- also set auth + headers (`x-api-key`)
- usage context of pb-api is both in by worker and in application

  - this means that some errors that are surfaced will be caught by application if in nest
  - otherwise, it should trigger a retry

- use existing `@Catch`? would work nicely so that i just `@Catch(FetchError)`
- good point made by oliver -> the decorator is set on the controller because the controller is the last thing before returning to user
- ie, the exception filter here only has to care about transforming error into status code
- hence, all that i am really doing is just implementing retries on fetch manually -> not much value

### Blockers

- need correct `env.development` -> copy over `PB_APIGW_KEY` + 1 more
- need to use oli's script to debug
  - can improve via using bullboard
