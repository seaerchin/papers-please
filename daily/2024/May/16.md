# Goals 
- [ ] make PR for FE stuff
- [x] do research for hierarchical data modelling
  - some brief comparison for nested sets/materialised paths/adjacency list/closure table
- [x] review zj work

# Work done 
- [x] helped zj with setting up datadog db monitoring 
  - this too way longer than expected -> unexpected failures whilst doing infra work. 
  - alot of config changes were duplicated across `prod/staging`, which opened us up to error 
  - this was p enjoyable
  - doc was good
- [x] did research + self learning on db hierarchical data modelling 
  - this took ~1-2 hours. still feel like i don't really understand, in-depth, the actual trade-offs involved
  - the articles felt very fluff and it felt like they were only giving a high level overview without going in-depth on how the different techniques performed

# Reflections 
- probably spent too much time reading articles for db modelling -> alot of them were repeated content. 
  - [ ] hard to determine good stopping point though
- should have clear idea of what needs to be done before diving in -> hampered when i realised i had to refactor FE code to ship timeline events
