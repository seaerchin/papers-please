# Goals 
- [x] make PR for timeline event on FE  

# Reflections
- taking very long for adding inputs to db -> not sure if got mock data i can just use
- didn't realise there was a notion doc on timeline events -> very inefficient on my end: 
  - had to manually add in json (slow)
  - wasted time overthinking the render on frontend (wasted)
