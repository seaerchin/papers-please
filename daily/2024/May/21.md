# Goals
- [ ] scope out tasking for backend
- [ ] start work on permissions model
- [x] work on adding show more for referral 

# Reflections
- helped clear up misunderstanding on NLB cross zone load balancing to kishore
- alot of hopping between misc nonsense that hampers deep work
- incidents -> eat up alot of time
- badly written code for code review is hard to read and wastes alot of time trying to understand + review
  - not entirely sure what to do here -> the abstraction of neverthrow isn't well understood by kish
  - maybe can pair with him
