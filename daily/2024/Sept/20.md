## flexbox

https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/

- default layout rules for flexbox:

  - primary: children bunched to start
  - cross axis: spreads to fill

- distribution along primary axis can be done using `justify-content`
- distribution along cross axis can be done using `align-items`

### definition of terms

1. `justify`: alignment along primary axis
2. `align`: alignment along cross axis
3. `content`: a group of items that must be distributed evenly along the axis
4. `items`: single items that can be singly positioned

### flexing

- flex grow/shrink is about the ratio.
- flex-basis sets the hypothetical minimum for the element. unless it's `flex-shrink: 0`, this is not treated as a hard limit but rather, a soft limit
  - if we set `flex-shrink: 0`, the `flex-basis` is treated as the hard limit and the css engine will respect it
- `flex-shrink` will not shrink children below min size UNLESS `min-width` is specified

### spaces between children

- use `gap` to allow spacing between each child
- use `margin: auto` to eat up extra space and apply it to the child's margin

### misc

- we can use `flex-wrap` to wrap items onto a second line. alternatively, can just use `grid`
