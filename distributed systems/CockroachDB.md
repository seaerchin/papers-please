# Introduction 
- modern transaction processing workloads are becoming increasingly *geo-distributed*
	- data must reside close to users to provide low latency (eg: edge computing)
	- *personal* data should adhere to local laws (eg: for EU citizens, stay within EU)
- cockroachDB aims to support the following technical features 
	1. fault tolerance and high availability -> CRDB (cockroachDB) maintains three replicas of every partition in DB across geographica zones 
	2. geo-distributed partitioning and replica placement -> CRDB is horizontally scalable and adds capacity as required 
	3. high performance transactions -> CRDB's transaction protocol supports performant geo-distrbuted transactions. this allows for *serializable isolatin* without specialized hardware.
