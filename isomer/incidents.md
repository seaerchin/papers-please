- think about what would you do in the incident 
	- can be more conservative because we have no SLAs -> just declare only 
- do we have user logs?
- add datadog alerts for when isomer tokens are used outside of our servers?
	- security alarms 
	- do we have any runtime alarms beyond just resource metrics?
