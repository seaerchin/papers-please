# Analysis 
- we need to do a full walk 
- dumb way is we will just walk top-down first 
  - once the cost at this node > total cost, we can return 
  
# solution 
- define a method that walks from current node to the leaf 
- this method should also return cost of walk + all paths that add to your target 
- take as input (target: number, node: Node) -> (path: number[])
