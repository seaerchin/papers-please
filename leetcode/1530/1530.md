# Analysis 
- do level order traversal first 
- store only the depth + current level including nulls 
- dist between direct children = 2 (1 up,1 1 down)
- dist between grandchild = `[2 (direct child) + 2 (child of child)]`
- need to walk the tree and store (depth, isLeaf)
- cost function between nodes at same level is constant (lets call cost c, c = 2 * level)
- if different level, formula is c - (diff in level)

# Solution
