# analysis

- when we have an edge, we can choose which node [i, j] is the one closer to the root
- greedily choose the lesser one 
- if i have 2 nodes [i, j] with an edge and depth [1, 2] (must differ by 1), i should always choose the lesser one as adding to the greater one will result in a greater height of the tree.
