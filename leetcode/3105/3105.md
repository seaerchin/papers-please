# analysis 

- since it's subarray, we only care about **contiguous**
- can just track `len_longest` + `len_shortest`
- track index of respective -> if not, can alr reset
- naive is just generate powerset of all possible sub arrays, filter and then sort by length

# solution 
- not very elegant, alot of repeated work.
- probably can extract into single function? 
- time complexity: o(n)
	- single pass over array
- space complexity: o(1)
