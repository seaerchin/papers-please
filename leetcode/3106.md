# analysis 

- must be absolute order 
- ascii seems useful for this? 
- distance <= k is enough, then we want to optimise for smallest string
- greatest distance is between middle and both ends
	- dist(n, z) == dist(n, a) == 12 
- each change we make "subtracts" from k 
	- eg: s = aaaa, k = 3 
	- t = baaa, k = 2 (1 replacement)
- we know the score of each replacement
	- greedily try to change from cur letter -> `a` as it is the smallest 
	- because is lexicographic, we always try to change the foremost letter **unless** we don't have enough score (k < required) 
	- then we move on to next
	- return when k = 0 or we hit end of string
