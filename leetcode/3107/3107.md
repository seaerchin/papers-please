# analysis 

- optimisation problem
- can just sort the array first
- our cost function is number of operations it takes 
- imagine an array [0, 1, 2] and k = 10 
	- we need to optimise from the upper end
	- we need to find the "slot" that k belongs to. 
	- then, find the numbers closest to that slot and keep adding/subtracting
