# analysis

- need to be alternating between pos/neg
- if the current sequence is wiggly, then the max wiggle of the current is
- store if the current array is a pos or neg wiggle sequence

# solution

1. in each iteration, check if the previous was a neg or positive difference
2. for each item in the remaining array, check if we shuold take this item
   a. we cnanot accept any item in the remaining array that has a difference of 0

# greedy property

- the greedy property is that the local optimum leads to the global optimum
- for this problem, notice that taking the current one is always the best move
  - why?
