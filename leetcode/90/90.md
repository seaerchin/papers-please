# analysis

- simple dfs problem. just go through the search space and make sure you clear the duplicates

# solution

## non backtracking

```py
class Solution:
    def subsetsWithDup(self, nums: list[int]) -> list[list[int]]:
        res: list[list[int]] = []
        nums.sort()
        l = len(nums)

        # another backtracking problem
        def solve(cur: list[int], idx: int):
            res.append(cur)

            if len(nums) == idx:
                return

            for i in range(idx, l):
                num = nums[i]
                if i > idx and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                    continue
                solve(cur + [num], i+1)

            return

        solve([], 0)

        return res
```

## backtracking

```py
class Solution:
    def subsetsWithDup(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = [[]]
        nums.sort()
        subset = []

        def backtrack(i):
            if(i >= len(nums)):
                return
            ## append the current number that we are working on to the subset
            subset.append(nums[i])
            res.append(subset[:])
            backtrack(i+1)
            subset.pop()
            while(i < len(nums)-1 and nums[i]==nums[i+1]):
                i+=1
            backtrack(i+1)

        backtrack(0)
        return res
```

- how the above works is by winding and unwinding the stack at every iteration
- we first build up the stack on our first pass through
- thereafter, when we recur up, we will already have the initial array in the stack
- as the function returns initially, we will `pop` the top number in the stack
- then, we check the current number is the same as the next number
- if it is, then we just advance to the next number
- else, recur again
- effectively, we never decrease the number until the stack unwinds
- this means that we will always backtrack until we hit something that the `while` condition holds true for
- then, we just do the check and recur again.
