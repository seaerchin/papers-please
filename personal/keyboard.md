# iris

- [x] mapping is wrong for numeric big thumb, should be dash instead
- [ ] number layer should have the quotes and lp remapped to other keys instead of having a crutch
- [x] remove esc key from outer so cannot crutch
- [ ] need to use permissive hold
- [x] mouse layer need to change so that the lower bindings are for wheel movemment

- [x] swap tab and backspace on left
- [x] swap enter and space on right

- [ ] try orbital mouse?

- [ ] try using the miryoku repo to create the .uf file instead of using qmk config
- [x] add mod keys to left side, reserve right side for macros

- [ ] use spaceman mappings for symbols, don't use the miryoku ones
