- end citizens: good site experience
- eye flow? is it worth going against norms now?
- optimise image properly
- stakeholder buy-in is via metrics so we need concrete metrics that show our value
- "intelligent, interested but ignorant" - great quote by Hong
- learn how to sell your products by metrics
- put a different (objective) objective so that people can align towards something objective rather than subjective
- people don't care about your product, they care about what your product does for them
- what problem does my product solve?
- sense of what the product is
  1. give a demo
  2. give concrete metrics
  3. why do these metrics matter to us? and to our stakeholders?
